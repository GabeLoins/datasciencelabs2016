      <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          In this assignment, you will be learning how to run a python program and how to get started using the language.
        </p>

        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <p>
          Absolutely NONE!! This lab is intended for all levels of experience. The class this year
          has veteran Computer Scientists as well as people who have never taken a class in the 
          department before. If some parts seem basic, stick with us. If some parts seem 
          complicated, ask a TA for help! The point is that after this lab, you should feel 
          comfortable writing and running some basic Python programs.
        </p>

      <h2>Why Python?</h2>
        <p>
          There are lots of programming languages out there, so why is this 
          class in Python? The top two most popular programming languages in Data
          Science are Python and R [see below]. Although R is a little more 
          popular for data science specifically, Python is easier to learn and
          much more flexible. Also, other classes at Brown use Python 
          (like CS16 and CS141) so it's a little more relevant here.

      <h2>Part 1: Running Python Code</h2>
        <p>
          You've just been named IKEA's head Data Scientist! Hooray! After brushing off
          the blue and yellow confetti, you remember your dark secret: you've
          never run Python code before. No problem- we're here to make usre you
          ace that first meeting with Ingvar Kamprad. If you're working from
          the Sunlab or MSLab (or any other department machine) you can skip
          over the installing Python section and right into creating your first
          program. 
        </p>

        <h3>Installing Python 2.7 (SKIP IF ON A DEPARTMENT MACHINE)</h3>
          <p>
            There are many valid ways to install Python 2.7 on to your own computer,
            just like the many ways to insert a tasteful IKEA loveseat into
            any living space. We recommend using Anaconda, which comes 
            with all the libraries you could ever want pre installed. Make sure
            you install 2.7 (TWO POINT SEVEN) and not 3!! Even though 3 is (yes)
            a larger number than 2.7 does not mean you should get it. It's
            pretty different than 2.7 and still not widely adopted. You
            can <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">
              install Anaconda 2.7 for Windows, Mac or Linux here.</a>
          </p>

        <h3>Creating Your First Program</h3>
          <p>
            Open the text editor Sublime, by typing sublime &amp; in your terminal
            (if you are on your own computer 
            <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">download sublime here</a>
            and run it however you like). If you prefer another text editor
            go ahead, but we'll assume you're using Sublime.
            First we will make the .py file you will write your program in.
          </p>
           
          <p>
            1. Create a new file: File &gt; New File
          </p>

          <p>
            2. Type <pre>print 'Hello Almhult, Sweden!'</pre>
          </p>

          <p>
            3. Save this file, File &gt; Save, naming it <code>helloAlmhult.py</code>. The .py is very important!!
          </p>

        <h3>Running Your First Program</h3>
          <p>
            Okay, you've made a Python program, you're a big shot. But the 
            Board of Directors in the IKEA International Headquarters (Delft, Netherlands)
            aren't gonna be impressed unless you can run it. Go to the terminal
            and navigate to the directory where you saved <code>helloAlmhult.py</code>. If
            you aren't familiar with using the terminal and commands like <code>cd</code>
            and <code>ls</code>, check out 
            <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs015/docs/commands.pdf">this quick reference guide</a>.
            Now type <pre>python helloAlmhult.py</pre> to run the program. 
            You should see your message appear in the terminal!
          </p>

          <p> Now let's work on making more complex programs to earn you some stock options. </p>

      <h2>Functions and Data Types</h2>
        <p>
          In Python there are functions, such as print(), that are built-in as well as others that are user-defined. You will be creating lots of functions throughout the course. Every function block in Python begins with the keyword <b>def</b> and ends with parentheses. These parentheses can take parameters or arguments as necessary. The <b>return</b> statement exits a function. Functions can be executed by having another function call on them, or directly from the Python prompt. For example: 
          <pre>
def print_this(str):
  print str
  return
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Numbers in Python are either integers or floats. An integer is a whole number, and floats are floating point numbers such as 3.65 and 52.3E-4. 
        </p> 
        <p>
          A string is a sequence of characters. Strings in Python are immutable, which means that you cannot change them. They can be indexed, with the first character at index 0. A string can be lots of characters or a single character. Python includes functions that can operate on string objects. You can see these string functions here: <a>https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string-functions</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Problem 1</h3>
          <p>
            Write a function, is_weekend, which takes in a day of the week and returns whether it's the weekend.
          </p>

        <h3>Problem 2</h3>
          <p>
            Write a function, add_numbers, that takes in two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. 
          </p>

        <h3>Problem 3</h3>
          <p>
            Write a function, replace, that takes in a string and replaces every space with a hyphen ('-').
          </p>
        <h3>Checkpoint 1</h3>
          <p>
            Run your scripts with your own input to test them out. Show them to a TA once you're done, or ask a TA if you need help.
          </p>

      <h2>Lists and Tuples</h2>
        <p>
          Python contains data types that are used to group values together. A list contains comma-separated values between square brackets. These values can be different types. Just like strings, you can index into an item of a list. Unlike strings, lists are mutable so you can change their content. For example,
          <pre>
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list[3] = 7
>>> my_list
[1, 2, 3, 7, 5]
          </pre>
          Lists are a flexible and extremely useful data type. Its functions include append(), sort(), reverse(), insert(), and more. Explore list functions here: <a>https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html#lists</a> </p>
          <p>
          A very useful operation with lists is list comprehensions. This is an easy way to create lists where each element is the result of some operations. Read more about list comprehensions here: <a>https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions</a>
          </p>
          <p>
          You can iterate through lists using loops. An commonly-used option is the for loop, which can iterate over the items of lists and strings. For example:
          <pre>
for letter in 'Hello':
  print letter</pre>
          You can also write a for loop that iterates by sequence index instead of iterating through each item. For example:
          <pre>
furniture = ['sofa', 'couch', 'dining table']
for i in range(len(furniture)):
  print furniture[i]</pre>
        </p>

        <p>
          Tuples are another standard sequence data type in Python. They consist of values separated by commas. While they can seem similar to lists, tuples are used differently since they are immutable. This is what a tuple can look like:
          <pre>
tup = ('chair', 'mirror', 'stove', 'shelf')
tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)</pre>
          Just like with lists, you can access values in a tuple by entering an index in square brackets.
        </p>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Write a function, print_chars, that takes in a string as an argument and prints out all the characters in the string.
          </p>

        <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Write a function, get_second_element, that takes in a list of tuples as an argument and prints out the second element in each tuple. 
          </p>

      <h2>Handing in</h2>
        <p>
          The folder you hand in must contain the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Stuff</li>
          </ul>
          Then run: <b>cs1951a_handin lab#</b>
        </p>
