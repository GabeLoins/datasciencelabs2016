      <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          In this assignment, you will be learning how to run a python program and how to get started using the language.
        </p>

      <h2>Why Python?</h2>
        <p>
          There are lots of programming languages out there, so why is this 
          class in Python? The top two most popular programming languages in Data
          Science are Python and R [see below]. Although R is a little more 
          popular for data science specifically, Python is easier to learn and
          much more flexible. Also, other classes at Brown use Python 
          (like CS16 and CS141) so it's a little more relevant here.

      <h2>Part 2: Functions and Data Types</h2>
        <p>
          In Python there are functions, such as print(), that are built-in as well as others that are user-defined. You will be creating lots of functions throughout the course. Every function block in Python begins with the keyword <b>def</b> and ends with parentheses. These parentheses can take parameters or arguments as necessary. The <b>return</b> statement exits a function. Functions can be executed by having another function call on them, or directly from the Python prompt. For example: 
          <pre>
def print_this(str):
  print str
  return
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Numbers in Python are either integers or floats. An integer is a whole number, and floats are floating point numbers such as 3.65 and 52.3E-4. 
        </p> 
        <p>
          A string is a sequence of characters. Strings in Python are immutable, which means that you cannot change them. Python includes functions that can operate on string objects. You can see these string functions here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string-functions
        </p>
        <h3>Problem 1</h3>
          <p>
            Write a function, is_weekend, which takes in a day of the week and returns whether it's the weekend.
          </p>

        <h3>Problem 2</h3>
          <p>
            Write a function, add_numbers, that takes in two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. 
          </p>

        <h3>Checkpoint 1</h3>
          <p>
            Run your scripts with your own input to test them out. Show them to a TA once you're done, or ask a TA if you need help.

      <h2>Handing in</h2>
        <p>
          The folder you hand in must contain the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Stuff</li>
          </ul>
          Then run: <b>cs1951a_handin lab#</b>
